## Hey, I'm Venkatesh
* Self-taught developer 👨🏻‍💻 proficient in C++, Python, Javascript and SQL.
* Self-taught meaning I am constantly learning new things
* For Web Development I prefer Next.js over just React
* Currently Looking 🔎 for a job, preferably as a Python developer.

### Here are some of my projects and what I learned from them :
* *[IndexCryptogram](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/IndexCryptogram)*: I learned to use WindowsBiometric Framework to extract fingerprint data and Python for image processing and feature extraction.
* *[Cryptography Library](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/cryptographyDll_project)*: I learned to make DLLs in Visual Studio and implemented multiple cryptography algorithms like MAC algo, Symmetric key encryption, asymmetric key encryption, and Hashing Algorithms.  
* *[Hulu_clone Frontend](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/hulu_clone_project)*: Learned to use the Next.js framework, implemented dynamic API routes, and learned some more about server-side and client-side rendering.
