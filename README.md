## About me
I am a self-taught developer who enjoys translating ideas into code. I use my projects as a medium to explore different concepts in programming. Some of my projects are:

* *[IndexCryptogram](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/IndexCryptogram)*: I learned to use WindowsBiometric Framework to extract fingerprint data and Python for image processing and feature extraction.
* *[Cryptography Library](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/cryptographyDll_project)*: I learned to make DLLs in Visual Studio and implemented multiple cryptography algorithms like MAC algo, Symmetric key encryption, asymmetric key encryption, and Hashing Algorithms.  
* *[Hulu_clone Frontend](https://github.com/Venkatesh360/hulu_clone_project)*: Learned to use the Next.js framework, implemented dynamic API routes, and learned some more about server-side and client-side rendering.
